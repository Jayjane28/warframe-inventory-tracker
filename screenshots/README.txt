WARFRAME INVENTORY TRACKER - SCREENSHOTS DIRECTORY

1. Save your Warframe inventory screenshots in this directory.
2. Name them something descriptive like "inventory_1.png", "resources.jpg", etc.
3. Run the application using:
   python run_app.py
   
Or to test specific screenshots:
   python test_processing.py screenshots/your_screenshot.png
   
When taking screenshots in Warframe:
- Make sure the inventory is well-lit
- Avoid overlapping menus/UI elements
- Full inventory grids work best
